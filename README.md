## Building from Source

This Readme assumes you're using [task](https://taskfile.dev/docs/installation).

### Building

Simply run `task build` to build. The binaries will appear in the `out/` directory.

You can also build for your specific platform with:

- `task build-darwin` for macOS
- `task build-linux` for Linux
- `task build-windows` for Windows
